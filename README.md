Hi! I‚Äôm Tam (Noa), a software engineering student with a passion for DevOps, frontend development, and thoughtful design. ‚ùÑÔ∏è  
I'm currently earning my B.S. in Software Engineering at Western Governors University, where I'm sharpening my skills across the stack‚Äîfrom building modern UI with React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS to automating development workflows with Docker, CI/CD, and cloud tools like AWS.

My background started in UI/UX and frontend, but my curiosity has naturally led me toward DevOps, systems thinking, and scalable architecture. I enjoy bridging the gap between development and deployment‚Äîdesigning intuitive interfaces while also ensuring they‚Äôre fast, reliable, and cloud-ready.

With experience in tools like Figma and Adobe Creative Suite, I approach engineering as both a creative and technical craft. Whether I‚Äôm prototyping user flows or spinning up containerized environments, I‚Äôm focused on building software that‚Äôs both elegant and efficient.

In essence, I‚Äôm on a mission to merge creativity with code‚Äîcrafting impactful digital experiences, one project at a time.
